# Guess My Secret Number

### A simply game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS

This was my introduction to Javascript using Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"

I followed all of his steps to create this little game, but I made some adjustments from what Jonas originally recommended.

This was also another helpful excercise in how to use git.
